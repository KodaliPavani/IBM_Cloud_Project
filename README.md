IBM SkillsBuild 4-Week Internship on AI & Cloud Technologies – Capstone Project
This document summarizes the final project completed during the IBM SkillsBuild 4-Week Internship on AI & Cloud Technologies, a program organized by IBM SkillsBuild, AICTE, and the Edunet Foundation.

🎯 Internship Objective
The goal of this internship was to provide hands-on experience in AI and Cloud Computing, helping students improve their practical skills and work on real-world problems using IBM tools.

📌 Intern Information
Name: KODALI PAVANI
College: KL University
Duration: 15th July 2025 to 7th August 2025 (4 Weeks)

📚 What the Internship Covered
The internship included online sessions, mentor support, and practical labs.
Here’s what was covered each week:
Week 1: Introduction, IBM Cloud account setup, basics of Artificial Intelligence
Week 2: Data Analytics concepts, Cloud tools, and hands-on labs
Week 3 & 4: Building chatbots, ML experiments, and using IBM AutoAI for projects
To complete the internship, students had to finish two IBM SkillsBuild courses and submit a final project.
💡 Capstone Project: Intelligent Classification of PMGSY Schemes

✅ Solution
We built a machine learning model that automatically classifies PMGSY projects based on their data. The model was trained and deployed on IBM Cloud, allowing it to make real-time predictions via a web service.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Cloud Platform: IBM Cloud

AI Tools: IBM Watsonx.ai Studio, IBM AutoAI

Languages/Libraries: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, ibm-watsonx-ai

🚀 Project Steps
Data Upload: PMGSY data was uploaded to IBM Cloud using the AI Kosh dataset.
Model Building: IBM AutoAI automatically handled preprocessing, feature selection, and model training.
Best Model Chosen: The XGBoost classifier gave the best results.
Deployment: The model was deployed as an online web service with a REST API.
Testing: The service was tested using sample data, and it worked successfully.

📊 Final Outcome
The model was accurate in classifying the project schemes.
It showed how AI can simplify government infrastructure monitoring.
The project met all the requirements for successful completion of the internship.
