 🌩️ IBM SkillsBuild 4-Week Internship on AI & Cloud Technologies – Capstone Project
This document summarizes the final project completed during the IBM SkillsBuild 4-Week Internship on AI & Cloud Technologies, a program organized by IBM SkillsBuild, AICTE, and the Edunet Foundation.

🎯 Internship Objective
The goal of this internship was to provide hands-on experience in AI and Cloud Computing, helping students improve their practical skills and work on real-world problems using IBM tools.

📌 Intern Information
Name: KODALI PAVANI

College: KL University

Duration: 15th July 2025 to 7th August 2025 (4 Weeks)

📚 What the Internship Covered
The internship included online sessions, mentor support, and practical labs.

Here’s what was covered each week:

Week 1: Introduction, IBM Cloud account setup, basics of Artificial Intelligence

Week 2: Data Analytics concepts, Cloud tools, and hands-on labs

Week 3 & 4: Building machine learning models and deploying them using IBM Cloud services

To complete the internship, students had to finish two IBM SkillsBuild courses and submit a final project.

💡 Capstone Project: Power System Fault Detection and Classification
✅ Solution
We developed a machine learning model to detect and classify different types of faults in a power distribution system. The model was trained using electrical measurement data (voltage and current phasors) and deployed on IBM Cloud for real-time fault classification through a REST API.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Cloud Platform: IBM Cloud Lite

AI Tools: IBM Watsonx.ai Studio, IBM AutoAI

Languages/Libraries: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, ibm-watsonx-ai

Dataset: Kaggle – Power System Faults Dataset

🚀 Project Steps
Data Upload: The fault classification dataset was uploaded to IBM Cloud using IBM Watson Studio.

Model Building: Using IBM AutoAI, preprocessing, feature engineering, and training were automated.

Best Model Chosen: The XGBoost classifier showed the highest accuracy among tested models.

Deployment: The model was deployed as a web service with a REST API endpoint using IBM Watsonx.ai.

Testing: The API was tested using sample input data representing fault scenarios – it correctly identified fault types.

📊 Final Outcome
The model was highly accurate in detecting and classifying power system faults such as line-to-ground, line-to-line, and three-phase faults.

This project demonstrates how AI can enhance real-time monitoring and maintenance of power grids.

The project successfully fulfilled all internship requirements and highlighted the effectiveness of IBM Cloud tools in solving real-world engineering problems.
